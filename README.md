# BUGs_HW-setup
Description of the instrumentation to detect and monitor diseases in mountain agriculture based on spectroscopy

In an nutshell, BUGs proposes a semi-automatic system that provides online thematic models to identify and classify plant diseases in mountain agriculture applications to foster small, localized management areas (centimeter-level resolution – leaves and insects scale). It uses unmanned aerial vehicles to quickly and efficiently manage three contrasting complex mountain scenarios: apple orchard monitoring *Alternaria*, *Plasmopara viticola* in a vineyard, and forest for *Thaumetopoea pityocampa* (Pine processionary).

This project includes the datasheets of the instruments that we use for our PREPARE experiment inside the Smart Agri Hubs project
